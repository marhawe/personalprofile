## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(MASS)
library(readxl)
data <- read_excel("RealEstate.xls")

## Random sample of 100
index <- sample(c(1:350), size=100, replace =F)
newData <- data[c(index),]
save(newData, file = "newData.Rdata")


# Naming Variables

## Sale Price
price <- newData$`Sale Price`
logPrice <- log(price)

## Age
age <- newData$Age
## Percent College - % in neighborhood who graduated college
college <- newData$`Pct College`
## # of Bedrooms
br <- newData$Bedrooms
## Lot size
size <- newData$`Lot Size`

fullMod <- lm(log(price) ~ age + college + br + size)
stepMod <- stepAIC(fullMod, direction = "both", trace = 1)

summary(stepMod)
plot(stepMod)

finalMod <- lm(log(price) ~ age + college + br + size)
summary(finalMod)
residuals(finalMod)
coefficients(finalMod)
attributes(finalMod)
plot(finalMod)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
